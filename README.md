"A Modified Inclined Planes system Optimization (MIPO) Algorithm"

* With the aim of create a powerful trade-off between the concepts of exploitation and exploration, and rectify the complexity of their structural parameters in the standard IPO, a modified version of IPO (called MIPO) is introduced as an efficient optimization algorithm for digital infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters model identification. The MIPO utilizes an appropriate mechanism based on the executive steps of algorithm with the constant damp factors. 

** For the first time, the proposed MIPO has been applied to IIR model identification problem. Also, to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it has been utilized for optimization of ten complex benchmark functions.
